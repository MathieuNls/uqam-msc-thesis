abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

In this paper, we propose a novel technique for dynamic analysis of software systems to identify the implementation of the software features that are specified through a number of feature-specific task scenarios. The execution of task scenarios and application of data mining algorithm sequential pattern discovery on the generated traces allow us to extract common functionality associated with the corresponding feature-specific task scenarios. The extracted patterns are used to identify the groups of core functions that implement software features. The proposed approach can be used for program comprehension and feature to source code assignment. A case study on the Unix Xfig drawing tool has been provided},

The learner is trained by analysing the similarities between the ext in the commit and the text in the comments posted by the dev. in the bug tracking system. They significally outporms classical heuristics (who looks for bug ID). Having more links can lead to better comprehension of the project management and can significantly enchance the perfomances of sub-sequent defect predictor which are trained with links between fix and bugs.},

abstract = {""This is the first book that promises to tell the deep, dark secrets of computer arithmetic, and it delivers in spades. It contains every trick I knew plus many, many more. A godsend for library developers, compiler writers, and lovers of elegant hacks, it deserves a spot on your shelf right next to Knuth.""--Josh Bloch""When I first saw the title, I figured that the book must be either a cookbook for breaking into computers (unlikely) or some sort of compendium of little programming tricks. It's the latter, but it's thorough, almost encyclopedic, in its coverage." "--Guy SteeleThese are the timesaving techniques relished by computer hackers--those devoted and persistent code developers who seek elegant and efficient ways to build better software. The truth is that much of the computer programmer's job involves a healthy mix of arithmetic and logic. In "Hacker's Delight," veteran programmer Hank Warren shares the tricks he has collected from his considerable experience in the worlds of application and system programming. Most of these techniques are eminently practical, but a few are included just because they are interesting and unexpected. The resulting work is an irresistible collection that will help even the most seasoned programmers better their craft.Topics covered include: A broad collection of useful programming tricks Small algorithms for common tasksPower-of-2 boundaries and bounds checkingRearranging bits and bytesInteger division and division by constantsSome elementary functions on integersGray codeHilbert's space-filling curveAnd even formulas for prime numbers!This book is for anyone who wants to create efficient code. "Hacker's Delight" will help you learn to program at a higher level--well beyond what is generally taught in schools and training courses--and will advance you substantially further than is possible through ordinary self-study alone. 0201914654B06272002},

Pellet is the first sound and complete OWL-DL reasoner with extensive support for reasoning with individuals (including nominal support and conjunctive query), user-defined datatypes, and debugging support for ontologies. It implements several extensions to OWL-DL including a combination formalism for OWL-DL ontologies, a non-monotonic operator, and preliminary support for OWL/Rule hybrid reasoning. Pellet is written in Java and is open source.},

While mining literature has been almost exclusively focused on frequent itemsets, in many practical situations rare ones are of higher interest (e.g., in medical databases, rare combinations of symptoms might provide useful insights for the physicians). Based on an examination of the relevant substructures of the mining space, our approach splits the rare itemset mining task into two steps, i.e., frequent itemset part traversal and rare itemset listing. We propose two algorithms for step one, a naive and an optimized one, respectively, and another algorithm for step two. We also provide some empirical evidence about the performance gains due to the optimized traversal.},

abstract = {Determined empirically the optimal number of alternatives for likert type scales. 360 students were used to test the 18 different likert type formats. 60 value statements were rated by ss on likert scales ranging from 2-19 points. In addition, each s was readministered the same form 3 wk. Later. The reliability and validity data for the different scales were then compared. Results show that (a) there were no specific patterns for reliability or validity coefficients using different number of alternatives; and (b) when the original scales were dichotomized or trichotomized, no significant differences were found in reliability or validity. Implications for users of rating scales are discussed. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown the promise of using utility functions to detect anomalous behavior in software systems at runtime. However, it remains a challenge for software engineers to hand-craft a utility function that achieves both a high precision (i.e., few false alarms) and a high recall (i.e., few undetected faults). This paper describes a technique that uses genetic programming to automatically evolve a utility function for a specific system, set of resource usage metrics, and precision/recall preference. These metrics are computed using sensor values that monitor a variety of system resources (e.g., memory usage, processor usage, thread count). The technique allows users to specify the relative importance of precision and recall, and builds a utility function to meet those requirements. We evaluated the technique on the open source Jigsaw web server using ten resource usage metrics and five anomalous behaviors in the form of injected faults in the Jigsaw code and a security attack. To assess the effectiveness of the technique, the precision and recall of the evolved utility function was compared to that of a hand-crafted utility function that uses a simple thresholding scheme. The results show that the evolved function outperformed the hand-crafted function by 10 percent.},

abstract = {Determined empirically the optimal number of alternatives for likert type scales. 360 students were used to test the 18 different likert type formats. 60 value statements were rated by ss on likert scales ranging from 2-19 points. In addition, each s was readministered the same form 3 wk. Later. The reliability and validity data for the different scales were then compared. Results show that (a) there were no specific patterns for reliability or validity coefficients using different number of alternatives; and (b) when the original scales were dichotomized or trichotomized, no significant differences were found in reliability or validity. Implications for users of rating scales are discussed. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

@book{Ghallab2004,
abstract = {Automated planning technology now plays a significant role in a variety of demanding applications, ranging from controlling space vehicles and robots to playing the game of bridge. These real-world applications create new opportunities for synergy between theory and practice: observing what works well in practice leads to better theories of planning, and better theories lead to better performance of practical applications. Automated Planning mirrors this dialogue by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date resource on both the theory and practice of automated planning. The book goes well beyond classical planning, to include temporal planning, resource scheduling, planning under uncertainty, and modern techniques for plan generation, such as task decomposition, propositional satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, and model checking. The authors combine over 30 years experience in planning research and development to offer an invaluable text to researchers, professionals, and graduate students. *Comprehensively explains paradigms for automated planning. *Provides a thorough understanding of theory and planning practice, and how they relate to each other. *Presents case studies of applications in space, robotics, CAD/CAM, process control, emergency operations, and games.*Provides a thorough understanding of AI planning theory and practice, and how they relate to each other. *Covers all the contemporary topics of planning, as well as important practical applications of planning, such as model checking and game playing. *Presents case studies and applications in planning engineering, space, robotics, CAD/CAM, process control, emergency operations, and games.*Provides lecture notes, examples of programming assignments, pointers to downloadable planning systems and related information online.},

abstract = {This paper studies the following problem: given a pair of business process models, determine which elements in one model are related to which elements in the other model. This problem arises in the context of merging different versions or variants of a business process model or when comparing business process models in order to display their similarities and differences. The paper investigates two approaches to this alignment problem: one based purely on lexical matching of pairs of elements and another based on error-correcting graph matching. Using a set of models taken from real-life scenarios, the paper empirically shows that graph matching techniques yield a significantly higher precision than pure lexical matching, while achieving comparable recall.},

abstract = {The presence of crosscutting concerns, i.e., functionalities that are not assigned to a single modular unit in the implementation, is one of the major problems in software understanding and evolution. In fact, they are hard to locate (scattering) and may give rise to multiple ripple effects (tangling). Aspect oriented programming offers mechanisms to factor them out into a modular unit, called an aspect. Aspect identification in existing code is supported by means of dynamic code analysis. Execution traces are generated for the use cases that exercise the main functionalities of the given application. The relationship between execution traces and executed computational units (class methods) is subjected to concept analysis. In the resulting lattice, potential aspects are detected by determining the use-case specific concepts and examining their specific computational units. When these come from multiple modules (classes) which contribute to multiple use-cases, a candidate aspect is recognized.},

abstract = {Metrics are paramount in every engineering discipline. Software engineering, however, is not considered a classical engineering activity for several reasons. In general, if a software system is seen to deliver the required functionality, only few people if any care about the internals. Moreover, defining, understanding and applying software metrics often looks like an overly complex activity, recommended only to 'trained professionals'. Lanza and Marinescu demystify the design metrics used to assess the size, quality and complexity of object-oriented software systems. Based on statistical information from many industrial projects and generally accepted semantics they deduce many single and combined threshold values. They show in detail how to identify collaboration and classification disharmony patterns in code, how to visualize their results using the freely available CodeCrawler visualization tool, and how to devise possible remedies. The combination of theoretically sound results and practically tested procedures and solution paths makes this book an ideal companion for professional software architects, developers and quality engineers. The pattern-oriented description of disharmonies offers easy access to detecting shortcomings and applying solution strategies. 'This well-written book is an important piece of work that takes the seemingly forgotten art of object-oriented metrics to the next level in terms of relevance and usefulness.' Richard C.

@article{Fournier-Viger2012,
abstract = {Sequential rule mining is an important data mining task used in a wide range of applications. However, current algorithms for discovering sequential rules common to several sequences use very restrictive definitions of sequential rules, which make them unable to recognize that similar rules can describe a same phenomenon. This can have many undesirable effects such as (1) similar rules that are rated differently, (2) rules that are not found because they are considered uninteresting when taken individually, (3) and rules that are too specific, which makes them less likely to be used for making predictions. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a more general form of sequential rules such that items in the antecedent and in the consequent of each rule are unordered. We propose an algorithm named CMRules for mining this form of rules. The algorithm proceeds by first finding association rules to prune the search space for items that occur jointly in many sequences. Then it eliminates association rules that do not meet the minimum confidence and support thresholds according to the sequential ordering. We evaluate the performance of CMRules in three different ways. First, we provide an analysis of its time complexity. Second, we compare its performance (in terms of execution time, memory usage and scalability) with an adaptation of an algorithm from the literature that we name CMDeo. For this comparison, we use three real-life public datasets, which have different characteristics and represent three kinds of data. In many cases, results show that CMRules is faster and has a better scalability for low support thresholds than CMDeo. Lastly, we report a successful application of the algorithm in a tutoring agent.},

@book{Daigneau2011,
abstract = {Web services have been used for many years. In this time, developers and architects have encountered a number of recurring design challenges related to their usage, and have learned that certain service design approaches work better than others to solve certain problems.    In   Service Design Patterns,   Rob Daigneau codifies proven design solutions for web services that follow the REST architectural style or leverage the SOAP/WSDL specifications. This catalogue identifies the fundamental topics in web service design and lists the common design patterns for each topic. All patterns identify the context in which they may be used, explain the constituent design elements, and explore the relative strengths and trade-offs. Code examples are provided to help you better understand how the patterns work but are kept general so that you can see how the solutions may be applied to disparate technologies that will inevitably change in the years to come.   This book will help readers answer the following questions:  How do you create a web service API, what are the common API styles, and when should a particular style be used?   How can clients and web services communicate, and what are the foundations for creating complex conversations in which multiple parties exchange data over extended periods of time?   What are the options for implementing web service logic, and when should a particular approach be used?   How can clients become less coupled to the underlying systems used by a service?   How can information about a web service be discovered?   How can generic functions like authentication, validation, caching, and logging be supported on the client or service?   What changes to a service cause clients to break?   What are the common ways to version a service? How can web services be designed to support the continuing evolution of business logic without forcing clients to constantly upgrade?  This book is an invaluable resource for enterprise architects, solution architects, and developers who use web services to create enterprise IT applications, commercial or open source products, and Software as a Service (SaaS) products that leverage emerging Cloud platforms.},
